<h2>About This Project üöÄ</h2>
<p>This repository is for keeping track of my daily challenges for <strong>Advent of Code 2024</strong> using TypeScript. Each day, new inputs and solutions are added.</p>

<h3>What is Advent of Code?</h3>

<p>Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.</p>
