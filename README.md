<h2>About This Project üöÄ</h2>
<p>This repository is for keeping track of daily challenges for <strong>Advent of Code 2024</strong> using TypeScript. Each day, new inputs and solutions are added.</p>

<h3>What is Advent of Code?</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Eric Wastl. I make Advent of Code. I hope you like it! I also make lots of other things. I'm on Bluesky, Mastodon, GitHub, and Twitter.</p>
<p>Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.</p>
<p>You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem-solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.</p>
<p>If you'd like to support Advent of Code, you can do so indirectly by helping to <a href="https://adventofcode.com">Share</a> it with others or directly via AoC++.</p>
